			<h4>Welcome to the PARTNERS CONNECT Survey.</h4>

			<p>  The purpose of these questions is to understand how you are currently doing and what your relationship is like. Your answers to this survey will be kept private. That means we will not share your responses with anyone outside the research team.</p>
			
			<h4 class="h4">This first section asks you some general health questions about yourself.</h4>		

				<p>Thank you for your interest in Partners Connect, an online program designed to help partners and spouses take care of their own needs and communicate to their loved ones in a positive manner. This project focuses on providing support to concerned military partners and spouses who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their service member’s alcohol use. </p>

				<p>Many others have been in these types of relationships. Research shows that family members can successfully learn skills to improve their mood, communicate effectively, help reduce their loved one’s drinking, and encourage them to seek help. This study hopes to develop an online program to accomplish these goals. </p>

				<h4 class="h4 mtop30">Important things to know about this study:</h4>
