                <h4 class="h4 mtop40">I. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? </h4>
                <p>RAND is developing a program to help support military partners concerned about their 
                service member’s alcohol use. The program’s goals are to help partners take care of 
                their own needs and communicate with their loved ones in a positive manner that might 
                help them reduce their drinking and seek help if needed. Your participation will help us 
                adapt the program to make it more helpful. RAND is a non-profit organization that does 
                research and this project is funded by the National Institutes of Health. </p> 
                
                <h4 class="h4 mtop40">II. WHAT WILL WE ASK YOU TO DO? </h4>
                <p>If you agree to participate, we will ask you to do three things:</p> 

                <div style="padding-left:20px;">
                <p> <strong>1. Complete five online surveys.</strong> We are asking you to complete a total of five surveys. 
                The first will take about 20-30 minutes and ask you multiple choice questions about your 
                physical and mental health, alcohol, recent events, and relationship or family 
                communication. The remaining four are satisfaction surveys about the online program 
                that take about 5 minutes each. You can complete all the surveys online and skip any 
                questions that you do not wish to answer. Your answers are confidential and will help us 
                better understand what you think about our online program and how it could be 
                improved. </p> 
                
                <p> <strong>2. Complete the online program.</strong> RAND will ask you to try out our online program. This 
                program, Partners Connect, is meant to teach and show you how to reduce the stress 
                you experience as a result of problems that come up around your partner’s drinking. The 
                program will be presented in 4 different online sessions, averaging about 30 minutes per 
                session, though some sessions may come close to 45 min. You will be able to access 
                the program 24/7 and go through the program at your own speed at home, or wherever 
                you have access to a computer and the internet, over a 6-week period. Ideally you would 
                complete each of the four online sessions about a week apart. </p>
                 
                <p> <strong>3. Tell us your opinions about the online program.</strong> After your fourth and last online 
                program session, someone at RAND will schedule a brief 30-minute phone interview to 
                ask you questions about the program. For example, we will ask you how easy or hard it 
                is to understand the program and what things you liked or did not like about the program.</p>

              </div>

              <p>The goals of the project are to understand whether our new program will be acceptable and 
              user-friendly to spouses and partners of military service members. RAND will pay you $45 for 
              completing the surveys and a bonus of $25 if you complete 3 of the four brief surveys. We will 
              also pay you $25 for completing the phone interview. This would be a total of up to $95.</p>
               
              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">III. COSTS</h4>

                <ul> 
                 <li>There is no financial cost to you for participating.</li>
                </ul>
               
              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">IV. BENEFITS </h4>

              <ul>
                <li>Although it is not a main goal of the program, and may not happen, changes you make 
                as a result of being in the program may improve your mood and also encourage your partner to do something about his/her drinking, if he or she is not doing something 
                already.</li>
                <li>You may also learn skills that may benefit your relationship and other areas of your life 
                (e.g., improved communication and problem-solving).. </li>
                <li>Your participation will also help us learn the best ways to help family members and their 
                partners cope with drinking in the household. </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">V. RISKS </h4>

              <ul>

                <li>You may feel uncomfortable from answering some of the questions on the survey or 
                participating in your session may be mildly upsetting. You can refuse to answer any 
                questions or leave the phone interview or online session at any time. </li>

                <li>As with any program such as this, some family conflict could arise should you participate 
                either against the wishes or knowledge of your partner. It is important for you to know, 
                however, that your partner's permission or his knowledge of your participation is not 
                required in order for you to participate in this program. It is entirely up to you to decide 
                whether or not s/he knows about your participation. We will not be talking to him/her 
                about your participation. Of course, changing how you cope with your partner’s drinking 
                problem as a result of participating in this program also could cause further conflict 
                between you and your partner. During your phone interview, we will ask you to tell us 
                about any conflict that occurs.</li>

                <li>In addition, we are asking you for an email address and phone number to contact you 
                regarding surveys, program material, and follow-up. While we will not identify ourselves 
                to anyone except you when calling, please be aware that it is possible your partner may 
                answer the phone when we call. Likewise, email is not entirely secure and if your partner 
                has access to your email, he/she may become aware of your involvement in the study.</li>

              </ul>

              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">VI. CONFIDENTIALITY </h4>
              <p>To help keep your information private, we have applied for a Confidentiality Certificate from the 
              Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This certificate assures that RAND is not 
              required to release information about you in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or 
              other proceedings, whether State, Federal, or local. The Certificate does not imply approval or 
              disapproval of the project by the Secretary of DHHS. </p>
               
              <p> <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:800;">Your confidentiality is very important to us.</span> We will never write your name, contact information, or 
              any other identifiers on our interview materials. Instead, we will use an ID number to protect your 
              confidentiality. We will only share this information with RAND research staff directly involved in this 
              study. We will not share the information you provide during the interview with the military, your family 
              members, or law enforcement officials. Your information will remain confidential except under the 
              following circumstances: </p>
              
              <div style="padding-left:20px"> 
                <p>1. If we need to protect you or others from imminent harm. An example of this is if you want 
                to hurt yourself or others. In that case, we will give information about you to others (e.g., 
                911, research staff) in order to protect you or others from harm.</p>
                <p>2. If you tell us about the abuse of a child or of an elderly person. In that case, we may 
                report it to the authorities.</p>
              </div> 
               
              <p>In order to remember the feedback you provide about the online program, we will audiotape the 
              phone interview so that we make sure we don’t miss any comments. The audiotapes will be 
              used to gather themes about what people think about our new program. No one outside the RAND research 
              staff will have access to these tapes. We will destroy all tapes at the end of the project and no later than August 2017.</p>
               
              <p>The internet survey meets stringent industry standards for security. Survey information is 
              protected using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology, which uses a private channel for 
              sending information over the Internet. This private channel allows “encryption,” which re-codes 
              the information so that it is meaningless to another person.</p> 
               
              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">VII. YOUR PARTICIPATION </h4> 
              <p>You don’t have to participate if you do not want to. You may withdraw from the study at any 
              time.</p>
               
              <h4 class="h4 mtop40">VIII. WHO IS LEADING THE PROJECT? </h4>
