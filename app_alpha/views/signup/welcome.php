	<p class="mtop50">Thank you for your interest in Partners Connect, an online program designed to help partners and spouses take care of their own needs and communicate to their loved ones in a positive manner. This project focuses on providing support to concerned military partners and spouses who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their service member’s alcohol use. Many others have been in these types of relationships. Research shows that family members can successfully learn skills to improve their mood, communicate effectively, help reduce their loved one’s drinking, and encourage them to seek help. This study hopes to develop an online program to accomplish these goals. </p>
